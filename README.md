# L-Trees
A simple 3D L-System that can easily generate trees and bushes

## Overview

The common way to model a tree involves manually construction of these and demands high skills and a great amount of time for the person doing this, and, generally, random fluctuations need to be done individually without compromising the tree's species indentity.
A procedural approach can effectively automate the generation, using predetermined instructions acting on an initial state, we can also include random parameters in the instructions to create variation between the trees.

The main objective of this assingment is to use Blender software to create a system for the procedural generation of 3D Trees using the L-Systems approach. To achive this goal, besides the basic L-System concepts, other techniques were also used, some of them are:

* Stochastic rules
* Parametric rules
* Tropism
* Bezier curve for the model

The fisrt section is dedicated to describe the procedural rules to generate the tree, while the second one for the surface's modelling.
