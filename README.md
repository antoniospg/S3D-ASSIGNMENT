## Overview

For this scene, I create a simple forest that a player can navigate through, using the models generated in the last assingment, importing them from Blender to Unity, as well as a particle system that self-progagates through the object's mesh.

The scene has three main parts that will be explained above, **the particle system**, **the forest**, and **the player**.
